# Reading Journal Solutions

Solutions to the Software Design Reading Journal assignments.

These are collected from the student answers, organized, and in some cases lightly
edited to comply with the PEP 8 Python style guide.

I've also added some solutions to illustrate specific points, including more advanced
features which have not been covered yet (and in some cases will not be covered in
this course).
